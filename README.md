## Introduction
The **Housing-ICP** project is an innovative approach to the real estate market that focuses on **tokenizing land assets** using the **Internet Computer Protocol (ICP)**. By leveraging the power of blockchain, we aim to create a decentralized and transparent platform where land ownership can be divided into digital tokens. This enables easier transactions, ownership tracking, and makes real estate investment more accessible to a broader audience. 

## Objectives
- **Decentralize Land Ownership**: Use blockchain technology to enable secure and transparent land ownership and transfer.
- **Fractional Ownership**: Allow for land parcels to be tokenized into smaller, tradable units, making land investment accessible to more people.
- **Efficient Transactions**: Utilize smart contracts on ICP for fast, low-cost, and secure transactions.
- **Transparency and Security**: Use blockchain's immutability to ensure that all transactions and ownership changes are transparent and tamper-proof.

## Technology Stack
- **Blockchain**: Internet Computer Protocol (ICP)
- **Smart Contracts**: Motoko (for ICP)
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript
- **Backend**: Node.js (for API and server-side logic)
- **Storage**: ICP Canister Storage
- **Testing**: Jest, Mocha

## Features
- **Land Tokenization**: Fractionalize land parcels into tokens that can be bought, sold, or traded.
- **Smart Contracts**: Secure and automated contract execution using ICP's blockchain.
- **Decentralized Marketplace**: A user interface for listing, buying, and selling land tokens.
- **Ownership Verification**: Track and verify land ownership transparently on the blockchain.
- **ICP Integration**: Use ICP’s unique architecture for high-speed and scalable transaction processing.

## Installation
To get started with the Housing-ICP project, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/nkatha23/Housing-ICP.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd Housing-ICP

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

## Usage
1. **Start the ICP Local Replica**: Follow the official ICP documentation to set up a local replica.
2. **Deploy the Canister**: Use the provided deployment scripts to deploy your smart contracts.
3. **Run the Application**: Start the frontend and backend servers.

```bash
# Deploy the canisters
dfx deploy

# Start the backend server
npm run start:backend

# Start the frontend
npm run start:frontend
```

4. **Access the Platform**: Open your browser and navigate to the specified URL (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`) to interact with the application.

## Project Roadmap
- **Phase 1**: Set up the ICP environment, and build initial land tokenization smart contracts.
- **Phase 2**: Develop the decentralized marketplace and create UI for tokenized land transactions.
- **Phase 3**: Implement fractional ownership and user wallets.
- **Phase 4**: Integrate with external APIs for land data and expand functionality.
- **Phase 5**: Test thoroughly and deploy to the ICP mainnet.
